Brain Tumor Detection AI: This project uses a deep learning model to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. Leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it classifies images as tumor or non-tumor. The model is trained on labeled data, aiming to assist in faster, more accurate diagnoses in medical imaging.
